📊 AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution built using Power BI, exploring sales, revenue, returns, and product performance for the AdventureWorks manufacturing business.

The goal was to turn raw CSV data into a clean data model and an interactive dashboard that delivers clear business insights.

🔧 Data Preparation (Power Query)

-- I connected multiple raw CSV files and performed key transformations:

-- Cleaned and structured the datasets

-- Fixed data types and removed errors

-- Created a proper Date table

-- Built lookup tables for Products, Customers, and Territories

-- Merged and appended datasets wherever needed

🧩 Data Modeling

-- A clean relational model was created using a star-schema approach:

-- Fact tables for Sales and Returns

-- Dimension tables for Products, Customers, Territories, and Calendar

-- Defined hierarchies for intuitive drill-downs

📐 DAX Measures

-- Calculated essential business metrics, including:

-- Total Revenue

-- Total Profit

-- Total Orders

-- Monthly Revenue / Orders / Returns

-- Return Rate

-- Supporting KPIs for visuals and trend analysis

📊 Dashboard Highlights
